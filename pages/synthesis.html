                <p class="description">
                    This project was undertaken to address the need for a <span>modern data management solution</span> that reduces data entry errors and enhances business operations 
                    while respecting <span>traditional processes</span>. By leveraging SQL and Python, I developed a project that <span>simplifies data entry</span>, 
                    ensures data integrity, and improved the data management workflow. The project involved creating SQL tables for products, shop areas, and transactions, 
                    along with an Excel format designed for efficient data entry. A Python application was also developed to automate the process of transferring data from Excel to SQL, <span>minimizing 
                    manual effort</span> and <span>reducing the likelihood of errors</span>. The implemented project is designed to accommodate various stakeholders, providing them with accurate and up-to-date information for decision-making.

                <p class="group_title">PROCESS</p>
                <p class="description">
                    My first step involved gathering all the requirements and identifying the necessary columns for the project. 
                    I created a simple SQL table for products, inserting all 31 products along with their interconnected column values. Following this, 
                    I developed a table for shop areas, <span>filling in gaps</span> to provide <span>additional context</span>, such as city, province, region, and island, 
                    since the available data only included barangay-level information.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    Next, I created a comprehensive transactions table that included all the essential columns, identical to those that I would later implement in Excel. 
                    After establishing all the required tables and inputting predefined values, I designed a <span>standardized format</span> in Excel. 
                    This format aims to minimize data entry while ensuring data integrity and accuracy. 
                    I maximized the use of <span>data validation</span> to streamline the workflow for data entry specialists.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    Now, letâ€™s discuss the exciting part: I developed a Python application that reads the Excel file and pushes the data to SQL. 
                    I utilized several powerful Python libraries for data handling, database interaction, and packaging. 
                    As a result, data entry specialists now only need to <span>input minimal data</span> into Excel, run the standalone Python application, and have the data <span>securely stored</span> in the database.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    I recognized that when data is pushed from Excel to SQL, the transactions table may contain incomplete information. 
                    This is because I simplify the data entry in Excel and broke down the data into three distinct tables. 
                    The first step in my SQL data transformation process involves modifying the Invoice No column values based on the payment method. 
                    Since SQL does not interpret custom formats from Excel but rather the actual input, this step is crucial.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    The second step is to check and update customer records with multiple age and/or gender entries. 
                    Gender should have only one value per unique customer, while age serves as nominal data in the transactions table, answering the question, "How old are you?"
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    The third step also involves a check and update process where <span>data entry specialists</span> play a <span>significant role</span>. 
                    I will <span>identify quantity pattern and outliers</span> in the data and, upon discovery, consult with the data entry specialists to verify and update the values accordingly.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    Finally, I performed <span>SQL joins</span> on the transactions table to include all records from the Transactions table along with the matching records from the Products and Areas tables. 
                    This data was then <span>organized into views</span>, which will serve as the <span>retrieval point for stakeholders</span> creating reports.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    The rationale behind breaking the data into different tables and subsequently joining them is to accommodate various stakeholders engaged in different processes.
                </p>

            <div class="grouping">
                <p class="group_title">LIMITATION</p>
                <p class="description">
                    If the user moves or renames the Excel file used for data entry, the Python application will fail to run. 
                    This <span>dependency</span> on the specific file path and name could lead to delay in the data entry process if the file is accidentally moved or renamed.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="grouping">
                <p class="group_title">RESULT</p>
                <p class="description">
                    This project successfully achieved its <span>goal of reducing data entry errors and enhancing business operations</span>. 
                    The development of SQL tables and the standardized Excel format has streamlined the data entry process, making it more efficient and accurate. 
                    The Python application has automated the transfer of data from Excel to SQL, significantly reducing the manual effort required and minimizing the risk of errors. 
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    Despite the limitations, the system has proven effective in organizing and managing the data, allowing stakeholders to access reliable information through 
                    SQL views for reporting purposes. The project has <span>provided a modern solution</span> that respects traditional operations, ensuring 
                    that data entry specialists can continue their work with <span>tools that improve accuracy and efficiency</span>.
