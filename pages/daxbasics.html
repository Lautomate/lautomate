            <p class="description">I used the cleaned dataset from the sales performance project and enhanced it in Power BI, utilizing various <span>DAX concepts</span> to gain deeper insights. 
            I employed basic DAX functions and concepts, such as <span>operators and operator overloading</span> for arithmetic, logical conditions, and <span>error handling</span>. 
            <span>Relational functions</span> like <span>RELATEDTABLE</span>, combined with <span>aggregators and iterators</span>, were used to dynamically calculate the rank of each product based on performance metrics. 
            I used <span>table constructors</span> to verify data existence under specific criteria and <span>table functions</span> such as <span>FILTER</span> to perform specific data calculations. 
            Additionally, I utilized the <span>Edit Interaction</span> feature to control cross-highlighting and cross-filtering behaviors.</p>
            <p class="description">
                Achieving meaningful and accurate insights would be significantly challenging without a well-structured and effective <span>data modeling</span> process. 
                In this project, I used <span>star schema</span> data modeling, incorporating both fact and dimension tables, to organize and optimize the dataset for analysis.
