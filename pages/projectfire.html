                The dataset used in this project was created by me by replicating actual possible data from a first-person shooting game. 
                This is inspired by a time attack or survival game mode where there is <span>no limit</span> to kills or deaths, but rather the focus is on time.

                    The goal of this project is to showcase my skills in creating a full-scale project from scratch, including creating my own dataset, 
                    asking questions, and visualizing the data.

                <p class="description">
                    For the past few weeks, I have enjoyed playing first-person shooting games during my free time. As a Data Analyst, I searched for a dataset related to the 
                    specific game I am playing, but I found that <span>no available data</span> existed. Therefore, I <span>created my own dataset</span> that is still connected to the game I love.
                    In this way, I can <span>enjoy playing the game</span> and, afterward, <span>enjoy working with the data</span> because it relates to something I am passionate about.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    At the end of this writing, you will see that I created a project from the very beginning. 
                    I developed my own dataset, stored it in SQL, retrieved it in Power BI using Power Query with SQL statements, and visualized it 
                    by combining narrative and interactive storytelling.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grouping">
                <p class="group_title">PROCESS</p>
                <p class="description">
                    The first process I did was identifying what the dataset will be such as player name, kills, maps, weapon, etc. 
                    After I successfully identified the necessary data I need in this project, I used Excel to generate those needs. 
                    I used <span>formulas and techniques</span> such as random generating number, lookups, deduplication, relative and absolute referencing.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    I load the data in SQL using the Import Flat File feature so that in the later phase of the project we can create <span>SQL statement</span> for data retrieval. 
                    In Power BI, I used the SQL connector to retrieve the data using SQL statements like SELECT to select data from the records and WHERE to filter the records. 
                    After successfully retrieving the data I then transformed it more in Power Query. I also utilized <span>data modeling</span> to create 
                    a structured representation of the data, ensuring relationships between different entities were well-defined and optimized for analysis.
                </p>

                <p class="description">
                    It's time to <span>answer questions</span> through <span>visualization</span> because visuals are the best way to explain <span>complex information</span>. 
                    Let's not forget to also use <span>DAX</span> to get the most out of the data and enhance data analysis. 
                    I performed some basic <span>concepts and techniques</span> such as arithmetic expressions, aggregations, table functions, and conditional logic to achieve 
                    the best results from the data. I also incorporated calculated tables and calculated columns because they allow for more dynamic and flexible data analysis, 
                    enabling me to create additional metrics and insights that are not directly available in the original dataset.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    This combined approach simplified complex models, performed calculations on aggregated data, and provided real-time responses to filters and user interactions.

                <p class="description">
                    The dataset consists of randomly generated values, which may lead to inconsistencies or unrealistic scenarios that do not accurately reflect actual gameplay. 
                    The dataset may not cover all possible scenarios or player behaviors, limiting the insights drawn from the analysis.

                <p class="description">
                    Through this project, I successfully visualized key performance metrics such as kills, deaths, headshots, player rankings, and other important metrics, 
                    which made it easier for the consumers of the report to analyze player performance and game dynamics.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    By combining <span>narrative and interactive</span> storytelling, I was able to engage with the data more meaningfully, enhancing my understanding of the 
                    gameplay experience and making it <span>accessible to users</span> who may not play games like this.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    This project allowed me to demonstrate my proficiency in various tools and techniques, including <span>Excel</span> for data generation, <span>SQL</span> for data management, 
                    and <span>Power BI</span> for visualization, showcasing my approach to data analysis.

                <p class="description">
                    Overall, this project not only improved my skills in data analysis and visualization but also deepened my understanding of 
                    how data can enhance the gaming experience, merging my personal passion with my professional expertise.
