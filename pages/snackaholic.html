            <p class="description">
                This project <span>aims to reduce data entry errors and enhance business operations</span>. 
                While some data entry practices may seem <span>outdated</span>, I am here to provide a <span>modern solution</span> that respects <span>traditional operations</span>. 
                Please note that this project <span>replicates the actual business scenario</span> but does not use the company's real data.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                My first step was to <span>gather all the requirements</span> and identify the columns needed for the project. 
                I created a simple SQL table for products, inserting all 31 products along with their interconnected column values. 
                Next, I developed a table for shop areas, filling in missing information to provide more context, such as city, province, region, and island, since the available data only included barangay-level information. 
                Subsequently, I created a comprehensive transactions table that encompasses all the necessary columns, identical to those in the Excel that I will build later on.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                After establishing all the required tables and inputting predefined values, I designed a <span>standardized format</span> in Excel. 
                This format aims to <span>minimize data entry</span> while <span>maintaining data integrity and accuracy</span>. I maximized the use of <span>data validation</span> to streamline their workflow.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                Now, letâ€™s discuss the exciting part: I developed a Python application that <span>reads the Excel file</span> and <span>pushes the data to SQL</span>. 
                I utilized a few but powerful Python libraries for <span>data handling, database interaction, and packaging</span>. 
                Data entry specialists will now only need to <span>input minimal data</span> into Excel, run the standalone Python application, and have the data <span>securely stored</span> in the database.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                I understand that when data is pushed from Excel, the transactions table may contain incomplete information. 
                This is because I broke down the data into three distinct tables to simplify data entry in Excel. 
                The first step in my data transformation process involves modifying the InvoiceNo column values based on the payment method. 
                Since SQL does not interpret the custom formats from Excel but rather the actual input, this step is crucial.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                Finally, I performed SQL joins on the transactions table to include all records from the 
                Transactions table along with the matching records from the Products and Areas tables, which I then fed into views.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                The rationale behind breaking the data into different tables and eventually joining them is to cater to various stakeholders who engage in different processes. 
                My goal is to provide <span>high-granularity data</span> while reducing their effort and increasing productivity.
