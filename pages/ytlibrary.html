                    The goal of this project is to create a <span>centralized view</span> that integrates data from multiple YouTube channels, 
                    allowing users to <span>analyze and monitor</span> channel performance without the need to visit each channel individually. 
                    By consolidating this information into a single Power BI report, the project streamlines 
                    the process of data analysis, saving time and enabling more efficient decision-making based on real-time insights.

                <p class="description">
                    I developed a comprehensive YouTube project in Power BI, leveraging Python to scrape data from multiple YouTube channels. 
                    The Python scripts are <span>directly integrated</span> with Power BI, allowing for seamless <span>data integration and real-time</span> updates. 
                    I utilized key libraries and frameworks for web scraping and asynchronous data retrieval, ensuring that the data was <span>collected efficiently and quickly</span>.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grouping">
                <p class="group_title">PROCESS</p>
                <p class="description">
                    I began by identifying all the YouTube feed URLs for the channels included in this project. Using Power Query, 
                    I gathered all the YouTube feed URLs and performed necessary transformations. This step was straightforward, as the feed is structured. 
                    However, the YouTube feed <span>provides incomplete data</span>, necessitating additional methods to obtain other important information.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    To address this, I employed Python and its libraries to expedite the process. 
                    I imported and installed the required <span>libraries and frameworks</span>, compiling a list of all the YouTube channel URLs. 
                    By combining <span>asyncio and aiohttp</span>, I enabled <span>concurrent requests</span> to all the specified URLs, 
                    allowing the project to process <span>multiple requests simultaneously</span> rather than sequentially.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    After receiving the data, I utilized Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML documents according to the criteria defined in my code. 
                    I selected specific tags and elements to retain valuable data while discarding irrelevant information. 
                    This library facilitated the web scraping process, making it efficient and manageable.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    However, a significant challenge when working with various YouTube channels without using an API is the inconsistency in data structure. 
                    To overcome this, I employed Python's Regular Expressions to match patterns, manipulate, and extract specific text accurately. 
                    Although this step was complex, it proved rewarding once I successfully identified the patterns across different channels.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    One of my objectives was to <span>run the script directly in Power BI</span> rather than on my local desktop. To achieve this, 
                    I put all my code in Power BI using the Python Script connector, utilizing the Pandas library to structure all my datasets into DataFrames, as required by Power BI. 
                    I also included Matplotlib, even though it was not used in this project, as it is a dependency for Power BI integration.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    After extracting data from various sources, I performed few transformations in Power Query, 
                    including <span>merging datasets</span>, <span>replacing values</span>, and creating <span>conditional columns</span>.

                <p class="description">
                    This project <span>successfully integrated data</span> from multiple YouTube channels into Power BI, providing a comprehensive view of channel performance. 
                    The Python scripts efficiently scraped the necessary data in <span>less than 30 seconds</span>, overcoming challenges related to inconsistent data structures across different channels.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    The final Power BI report included key performance indicators (KPIs) such as <span>total views</span>, <span>subscriber growth</span>, <span>video engagement</span>, and <span>content performance</span> across all sampled YouTube channels. 
                    The data visualizations provided clear and actionable insights, enabling users to understand trends and patterns in the data effectively.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    Despite the limitation of retrieving a maximum of 15 videos per channel, the report provided a strong analysis of channel performance, 
                    demonstrating the value of automated data collection and integration processes in a business context.
