                    The dataset used in this project was created by me and <span>replicates actual sentiment analysis</span> in the real world. 
                    New data is <span>updated regularly</span> up to the end of the year.

                    The goal of this project is to extract emotions from text, whether <span>positive</span>, <span>negative</span>, or <span>neutral</span>, using Python and visualize it in Power BI. 
                    This makes it easy for businesses to understand <span>user perceptions</span> of their products.

                <p class="description">
                    Texts provide a <span>rich source of qualitative information</span> in data analysis, revealing hidden insights such as opinions, emotions, and sentiments.
                     By creating a sentiment analysis, businesses can improve products, enhance brand reputation, and strengthen customer relations.

                <p class="description">
                    Through the proper use of tools like VADER Sentiment and Power BI to visualize the results, 
                    I delivered a <span>full-scale project</span> that positions businesses to better understand how they approach their customers based on customer sentiments.

                <p class="group_title">PROCESS</p>
                <p class="description">
                        The first step I took was to scan the dataset. I found that not all text was written in English; it included <span>different languages</span> from various users. 
                        The VADER Sentiment tool only accepts English text, and manually translating non-English text was not feasible as it counters the motive of automation. 
                        Therefore, I used a Python library called googleTrans to <span>detect and translate non-English</span> text into English. 
                        Given the dataset's size, I utilized <span>asynchronous methods</span> to handle the large volume of translations, along with filtering techniques to translate only non-English texts.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    Some texts involved <span>irony</span>, <span>sarcasm</span>, or <span>dialects</span> that are difficult to translate into English, which <span>posed challenges</span> for the tool. 
                    To address these elements, I created a <span>custom sentiment extension</span> using Python lists. 
                    I then tested the results to ensure that the texts were accurately tagged as positive, negative, or neutral.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    Finally, I loaded the data to perform visualization and add necessary DAX elements in order to showcase the results.

                <p class="description">
                    Some idiomatic expressions, sarcasm, and cultural references may not be accurately captured by the sentiment analysis, 
                    even with the custom sentiment extension I created, as the growing volume of data makes it challenging to handle and may lead to misclassification of sentiments.
                </p>

                <p class="description">
                    The sentiment analysis <span>revealed</span> valuable insights into <span>customer perceptions</span>, providing a clear breakdown of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. 
                    Visualizations in Power BI highlighted <span>trends and patterns</span>, allowing stakeholders to identify areas for improvement and better understand user feedback. 
                    Overall, the project successfully demonstrated the potential of sentiment analysis in enhancing business strategies and customer relations.
