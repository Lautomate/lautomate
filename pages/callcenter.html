                    The goal of this project is to <span>improve the call center data analysis</span> originally performed in Excel by K S Ashish. 
                    It will tackle historical data and provide insights in a clear way.

                    I have always been fascinated and curious about what it is like to be a data analyst in the BPO industry. 
                    I researched possible datasets, questions, and analyses, and found that in-house data is most likely the dataset used in this industry. 
                    Fortunately, I came across a Medium post where the author provided a downloadable dataset. 
                    The post is considered a case study that explores the data, develops an argument, and offers excellent insights and recommendations.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    At the end of this writing, you will see that I <span>developed a Power BI project</span> analyzing the improved data, delivering more impactful insights while 
                    demonstrating my <span>abilities to enhance</span> previous projects.

                    The first step I took was to load the data in Power Query to clean and transform the <span>semi-clean</span> data. 
                    I <span>removed unnecessary columns</span> while ensuring that the removed columns <span>did not affect</span> the analysis. 
                    I then performed my favorite text cleaning and transformation techniques, namely trimming, cleaning, and replacing double spaces with single space values. 
                    The area column contains both the city and its abbreviation; therefore, I replaced it using the replace value technique in one step. 
                    I also adjusted the call time column to reflect the relevant year and month for this project.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    Before loading the data, I <span>further investigated</span> using the <span>column profiling</span> feature in Power BI to give me an overview of the dataset. 
                    One discovery was the granularity of the date, which is daily. To address this, I created a simple date dimension table to cater time-series demands. 
                    After this, it was time to load the data and perform the visualization.

                    The dashboard page displays almost the same metrics as those in the article, with <span>slight tweaks</span> in the <span>design</span> aspects and <span>insights</span>.

                <p class="group_title">RESULT</p>
                <p class="description">
                    The results of this project reveal that <span>values are consistent</span> throughout the month, with <span>little to no changes</span> in the KPIs and metrics. 
                    This suggests that management or decision-makers should consider improving strategies or interventions to enhance performance.

                <p class="description">
                    The analysis presents information in a <span>clear and understandable</span> manner, using appropriate visuals to either <span>break down</span> or <span>aggregate</span> values. 
                    This approach enhances the communication of insights and supports better decision-making, particularly in tracking business performance based on the available customer data.
