            <p class="description">I created a dataset that mirrors actual business data, encompassing various aspects of book sales. 
                To ensure the dataset was realistic, I included elements such as sales figures, genres, and customer demographics.</p>
            <p class="description">I performed comprehensive data cleaning and transformation processes to replicate the reality of a data analyst's work. 
                This involved handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and standardizing formats. A particular challenge was the Discount column, where the values were based on vague criteria. 
                Through meticulous cleaning and transformation, I ensured that the data was accurate and reliable.</p>
            <p class="description">I applied all the fundamental data analytics processes to this dataset from asking questions to visualization. </p>
            <p class="description">I used the <span>SUMIFS</span> function in Excel to dynamically calculate sales based on various conditions. 
                To determine the current quarter, I employed the <span>TODAY() and ROUNDUP()</span> functions. I also implemented <span>data validation</span> for dropdown menus. 
                <span>Absolute referencing</span> was essential for creating interactive graphs, as it prevents the references from breaking.</p>
            <p class="description">Despite the challenges, I managed to deliver exactly what the business wanted and needed. 
                The final dataset and the insights derived from it provided a clear picture of sales performance, helping to inform strategic decisions.</p>
