                    The goal of this project is to create a <span>compelling narrative</span> from a small and straightforward dataset. 
                    This will provide <span>decision-makers</span> in the smartphone industry with <span>valuable insights to inform</span> their strategies.

                <p class="group_title">INTRODUCTION</p>
                <p class="description">
                    I downloaded a dataset from Kaggle and subsequently converted values to improve the storytelling. 
                    These enhancements were designed to provide a clearer understanding of user behaviors and preferences between Android and iPhone users.
                </p>

                <p class="group_title">PROCESS</p>
                <p class="description">
                    I began by investigating the dataset to ensure its completeness for the questions I aimed to answer. The "User Behavior Class" column contained numeric identifiers. 
                    To <span>simplify</span> the analysis, I replaced these numbers with <span>descriptive labels</span> using the <span>assistance of ChatGPT</span>. 
                    I did not impose my own sentiments; instead, I followed the established patterns associated with each number. 
                    For instance, a user with minimal screen-on time was identified by the number 1, while a user with significantly higher screen-on time was identified by the number 5. 
                    Thus, I replaced 1 with "Minimal User," 2 with "Light User," and so on.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    Additionally, the age column was presented in a highly granular format. To make the analysis more manageable, I created age brackets to segment the data effectively. 
                    After these modifications, I proceeded to analyze the final dataset and <span>answer key questions</span> through <span>visuals and storytelling</span>.

                <p class="group_title">LIMITATION</p>
                <p class="description">
                    The dataset includes four different Android devices compared to only one iPhone model. This <span>disparity</span> may limit the comparability of user behavior insights, 
                    as the diversity of Android devices can lead to variations in usage patterns that are not present in the single iPhone model. 
                    Additionally, the dataset may not capture all relevant factors influencing smartphone usage, such as geographic location, socioeconomic status, or specific user preferences.

                <p class="description">
                    The results of this project <span>reveal trends and patterns</span> in smartphone usage between Android and iPhone users across different age brackets that may not be commonly 
                    recognized in today's society. For instance, differences in app usage, screen time, and user engagement levels highlight distinct preferences and behaviors 
                    associated with each platform. Visual representations of the data, such as charts and graphs, <span>effectively illustrate</span> these insights, 
                    making it <span>easier for decision-makers to understand</span> user behaviors and preferences. This information can inform marketing strategies, product development, 
                    and customer engagement initiatives within the smartphone industry.
